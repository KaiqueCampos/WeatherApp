#### This is a project that was requested as an activity for the Mobile Programming module of the Systems Analysis and Development course at Etec Taboão da Serra.

The application through geolocation and the HG Weather API shows us in the main menu:
 - Temperature 
 - Climate conditions 
 - Forecasts for the coming days

It is also possible to get the results of a specific location by searching for it in the "Search" tab of the menu.

Another feature is to change the background image according to conditions: day or night.
